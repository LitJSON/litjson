	* test/JsonReaderTest.cs:
	* test/Makefile.am:
	  Skip long test for now since mono 1.2.5 has a problem in
	  Int32.TryParse which affects this library.

2007-08-15  Leonardo Boshell  <leonardoboshell@users.sourceforge.net>

	=== Release 0.3.0 ===

2007-08-14  Leonardo Boshell  <leonardoboshell@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/LitJson/JsonMapper.cs: Added Importers functionality, similar to
	the way exporters work.
	* test/JsonMapperTest.cs: Added tests for the importers.

2007-08-14  Leonardo Boshell  <leonardoboshell@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/LitJson/JsonWriter.cs: Added Write(ulong number) overload.

	* src/LitJson/JsonMapper.cs: Added Exporters functionality. Base
	exporters are implemented to convert basic Value types such as byte,
	char, DateTime, etc. to JSON. Custom exporters can be added through
	JsonMapper.RegisterExporter(). Also, ToJson() now throws an exception if
	a certain nesting limit is reached to avoid infinite loops.

	operation, use a static instance of JsonWriter, improving performance
	for multiple object->JSON conversions.

2007-08-14  Leonardo Boshell  <leonardoboshell@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/LitJson/JsonData.cs: Added public Count property. Fix int indexer
	logic to work both when it's an array and an object.
	* src/LitJson/JsonMapper.cs: Added two new methods, ToJson(object,
	JsonWriter) and ToObject(JsonReader), so the mapping can be customized
	through JsonWriter and JsonReader objects.
	* test/JsonMapperTest.cs: Added new tests for the new JsonMapper
	methods.

2007-08-13  Leonardo Boshell  <leonardoboshell@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/LitJson/JsonReader.cs:

	strings are allowed or not. This parameter is true by default.

	* doc/manual/sources/appendices/parser/parser.xml: Simplify lexer table
	and include the new behaviour regarding single-quoted strings.
